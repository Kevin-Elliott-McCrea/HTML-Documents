# Repository summary

Here you will find plenty of fundamental HTML and CSS code in the corresponding folders. 

There are also several websites that showcase my evolution of skill in HTML and CSS fundamentals. You will also see the development of my portfolio website, which is completed and hosted in a separate GitHub repository.

The folder titled HTML course before upgrade is merely sectioning off code I wrote before a change in the curriculum occurred. This just means that I may have repeated some excercises.
